# How to get the selected dates using the selection changed callback in the Flutter Calendar?

This example demonstrates how to get the selected dates using the selection changed callback in the Flutter Calendar.

## Obtaining selected dates

Using the [onSelectionChanged](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/SfCalendar/onSelectionChanged.html) callback, you can get the selected details from the Flutter Event Calendar and display them in the Alert dialog window. When the controller's selected date changes, the onSelectionChanged callback is triggered.
